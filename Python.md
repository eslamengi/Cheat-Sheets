## Dealing with files and folders

```python
import os

# Get the current working directory
os.getcwd()

# Change the working directory
os.chdir(file_path)

# Rename file names
os.rename(current_filename,new_filename)

# Open a file, read it and close it
texts = open(fille_path)
content = texts.read()
texts,close()

```

## Strings

```python
# strings are immutable (they cannot be changed).

# Join: joins two strings together
result = '1234'.join("567")
===
result = '1234' + '567'
# result = "1234567"

# Methods
s = "apple"
s.startswith("a")
s.endswith("e")
s.isdigit()
s.isspace()
s.lower()
"box" in "box of life"
1 in [1,2,3]
'abracadabra'.find('cad')
'badger badger badger mushroom'.count('bad')
```

## Lists

```python
# Mutable. That means you can change the items in a list after it has been created.

words = ["echidna", "dingo", "crocodile", "bunyip"]

# Adds its argument as a single item to the end of the list. It only ever adds one item to a list.
words.append("platypus")

# Treats its argument as a sequence and adds each item in the sequence to the end of the list. In other words, it adds a sequence of items to a list.
words.extend("abc")
# ['echidna', 'dingo', 'crocodile', 'bunyip', 'platypus', 'a', 'b', 'c']

# Adds each item of this list to the end of the words list
words.extend(["kangaroo", "wallaby"])

# reverse the order of the list
words.reverse()

# Sort the list in ascending order
words.sort()
```

## While loop

```python
n = 10
while n > 0:
    print(n)
    n -= 1
    time.sleep(1)
print("Blastoff!")
```

## Tricks

1. Augmented assignment

   ```python
   # The effect of n = n + 1 and n += 1 is the same. The latter is called an augmented assignment statement, because it's an assignment statement but it augments the existing value rather than replacing it.

   # So augmented assignment is not only shorter, but also can catch some errors that otherwise might creep into the code.
   n += 1
   n -= 1
   n *= 1
   n /= 1
   ```

2. Comprehension function:

   - The below line code has for loop and if condition in the same line

     ```python
     ''.join(i for i in name if not i.isdigit())
     ```

3. Change data type

   ```python
   import numpy as np
   # convert string to int
   int("123")

   # convert int to string
   str(123)

   # convert list to array
   arr = np.array([0,1,2])

   # convert array to list
   lst = list(arr)
   ```

## Draw on screen using Turtle module

```python
import Turtle

# Initialize a turtle object
sharaflex = turtle.Turtle()

# Change its color
sharaflex.color("purple")

# Movements
sharaflex.forward(100)
sharaflex.right(90)
sharaflex.backward(100)
sharaflex.left(90)

# Draw a circle
sharaflex.circle(100)

# Current coordination
sharaflex.xcor()
sharaflex.ycor()

# Change object shape
sharaflex.shape("turtle")

# Stop drawing
sharaflex.penup()

# Continue drawing
sharaflex.pendown()

# Increase drawing line width
sharaflex.width(5)

# Increase drawing speed
sharaflex.speed(6)
sharaflex.speed(0) # Max speed

# Hide turtle
sharaflex.hideturtle()

# Initiate the screen object to manipulate it
window = turtle.Screen()

# change screen background
window.bgcolor("red")

# Close the screen after clicking
window.exitonclick()

# Finish Drawing
turtle.done()
```

## Classes

1. Creating classes in a separate file

   ```python
   # Create a class
   class Movie():
       # class documentation
       """This class provides a way to store movie related information"""
       #Class variables
       VALID_RATINGS = ['G', 'PG', 'PG-13', 'R']
       # Define Constructor (Initialization function) that runs whenever an    instance is created
       # self is the instance object name
       def __init__(self, movie_title, movie_storyline, poster_image,  trailer_youtube):

           #define Instance variables
           self.title = movie_title
           self.storyline = movie_storyline
           self.poster_image_url = poster_image
           self.trailer_youtube_url = trailer_youtube
       # Define Instance methods
       def show_trailer(self):
           webbrowser.open(self.trailer_youtube_url)

   # Create an inheritance class
   class Stats(Movie):
       def __init__(self, movie_title, movie_storyline, poster_image,  trailer_youtube,cast,budget):
           Movie.__init__(self, movie_title, movie_storyline, poster_image,    trailer_youtube)
           self.cast = cast
           self.budget = budget

   # Note that parent method can be overridden by creating the method in the child class

   # Predefined class variables:
   __doc__ # documentation for the class
   __name__
   __module__
   ```

2. Import the class file and use it

   ```python
   import media
   # create an instance of the inheritance(child) class
   toy_story = media.Stats(
       "Toy_story",
       "A cowboy doll is profoundly threatened and jealous when a new  spaceman figure supplants him as top toy in a boy's room.",
       "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114709/?ref_=ttpl_pl_tt",
       "https://www.imdb.com/video/imdb/vi2052129305?playlistId=tt0114709& ref_=tt_ov_vi",
       "42","45M")
   # calling a method from the parent class
   toy_story.show_trailer()
   # Note that parent method can be overridden by creating the method in the child class
   ```

## HTTP servers

1. Send request

   ```python
   # 1. Import http.server, or at least the pieces of it that you need.
   from http.server import HTTPServer, BaseHTTPRequestHandler

   # 2. Create a subclass of `http.server.BaseHTTPRequestHandler`. This is your handler class.
   class HelloHandler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):
   # 3. Define a method on the handler class for each **HTTP verb** you want to handle.
   def do_GET(self):
   # Inside the method, call built-in methods of the handler class to read the HTTP request and write the response.

       # First, send a 200 OK response.
       self.send_response(200)

       # Then send headers.
       self.send_header('Content-type', 'text/plain; charset=utf-8')
       self.end_headers()

       # Now, write the response body.
       paths = self.path # This instance returns the request path
       # The name wfile stands for writeable file.
       # self.wfile represents the connection from the server to the client; and it is write-only; hence the name
       # to send a string over the HTTP connection, you have to encode the string into a bytes object.
       self.wfile.write(path[1,:].encode())

    # This code will run when we run this module as a Python program,rather        than importing it.
    if __name__ == '__main__':
    server_address = ('', 8000)  # Serve on all addresses, port 8000.
    # 4. Create an instance of `http.server.HTTPServer`, giving it your handler class and server information — particularly, the port number.
    httpd = HTTPServer(server_address, HelloHandler)
    # 5. Call the `HTTPServer` instance's `serve_forever` method.
    httpd.serve_forever()
   ```

2. Parse query string

   ```python
   from urllib.parse import urlparse, parse_qs
   address = 'https://www.google.com/search?q=gray+squirrel&tbm=isch'
   parts = urlparse(address)
   print(parts)
   #ParseResult(scheme='https', netloc='www.google.com', path='/search',    params='', query='q=gray+squirrel&tbm=isch', fragment='')
   print(parts.query)
   #q=gray+squirrel&tbm=isch
   query = parse_qs(parts.query)
   query
   #{'q': ['gray squirrel'], 'tbm': ['isch']}
   ```

3. Redirect to the root

   ```python
   # Send a 303 back to the root page
       self.send_response(303)  # redirect via GET
       self.send_header('Location', '/')
       self.end_headers()
   ```

4. Send an HTML form

   ```python
   form = '''<!DOCTYPE html>
   <title>Message Board</title>
   <form method="POST">
   <textarea name="message"></textarea>
   <br>
   <button type="submit">Post it!</button>
   </form>
   <pre>
   {}
   </pre>
   '''

   class MessageHandler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):
       def do_GET(self):
       # First, send a 200 OK response.
       self.send_response(200)

       # Then send headers.
       self.send_header('Content-type', 'text/html; charset=utf-8')
       self.end_headers()

       # Send the form with the messages in it.
       mesg = form.format("\n".join(memory))
       self.wfile.write(mesg.encode())
   ```

5. Requests library can do the following

   1. Make a Request
   2. Passing Parameters In URLs
   3. Response Content
   4. Binary Response Content
   5. JSON Response Content
   6. Response Status Codes
   7. Custom Headers
   8. Cookies
   9. and many [more](https://2.python-requests.org//en/master/user/quickstart/) ...

6. Concurrency

   ```python
   import threading
   from socketserver import ThreadingMixIn

   class ThreadHTTPServer(ThreadingMixIn, http.server.HTTPServer):
       "This is an HTTPServer that supports thread-based concurrency."

   if __name__ == '__main__':
   port = int(os.environ.get('PORT', 8000))
   server_address = ('', port)
   httpd = ThreadHTTPServer(server_address, Shortener)
   httpd.serve_forever()
   ```

7. Cookies

   To set a cookie from a Python HTTP server, all you need to do is set the `Set-Cookie` header on an HTTP response. Similarly, to read a cookie in an incoming request, you read the `Cookie` header. However, the format of these headers is a little bit tricky; I don't recommend formatting them by hand. Python's `http.cookies` module provides handy utilities for doing so.

   To create a cookie on a Python server, use the SimpleCookie class. This class is based on a dictionary, but has some special behavior once you create a key within it:

   ```python
   from http.cookies import SimpleCookie, CookieError

   out_cookie = SimpleCookie()
   out_cookie["bearname"] = "Smokey Bear"
   out_cookie["bearname"]["max-age"] = 600
   out_cookie["bearname"]["httponly"] = True
   ```

   Then you can send the cookie as a header from your request handler:

   ```python
   self.send_header("Set-Cookie", out_cookie["bearname"].OutputString())
   ```

   To read incoming cookies, create a SimpleCookie from the Cookie header:

   ```python
   in_cookie = SimpleCookie(self.headers["Cookie"])
   in_data = in_cookie["bearname"].value
   ```

   Be aware that a request might not have a cookie on it, in which case accessing the `Cookie` header will raise a `KeyError` exception; or the cookie might not be valid, in which case the `SimpleCookie` constructor will raise `http.cookies.CookieError`

   **Important safety tip**: Even though browsers make it difficult for users to modify cookies, it's possible for a user to modify a cookie value. Higher-level web toolkits, such as Flask (in Python) or Rails (in Ruby) will cryptographically sign your cookies so that they won't be accepted if they are modified. Quite often, high-security web applications use a cookie just to store a session ID, which is a key to a server-side database containing user information.

   For a lot more information on cookie handling in Python, see the documentation for the [http.cookies module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.cookies.html).
